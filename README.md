The Odin Project Foundations HTML Foundations Project: Recipes.

This project demonstrates basic HTML as presented in the lessons. This includes 
basic web site layout and file organizations; basic tags; headings; paragraphs;
ordered and unordered lists; links to other pages in the site; and images.

Recently, I had done some canning of apples so I decided to base my version of
this project on a few of my favorite canning recipes.

Feel free to leave feeback.
